This site is intended to catalog the collection of a particular household that has the largest collection of Micropolis modules that we are currently aware of. While hopefully a site that is useful to any visitor to one of our displays we also hope that it is a useful resource for other Micropolis builders.

I'm 47 years old and never stopped playing with LEGOs. When I'm not building Micropolis I teach philosophy at Metropolitan State University, homeschool my kids, care for my three dogs, fourteen gerbils, and tank of giant African millipedes, and obsess about BBC Sherlock fandom.

After my divorce in 2005, I was looking for something to occupy my time and had always looked back with fondness on my youth playing with LEGO. Back in those days I was always disappointed that I didn't have the money to have all the parts I wanted to be able to build the wild and crazy stuff in my head. As a reasonably well paid computer geek with a lot of free time on my hands there didn't seem to be any reason I couldn't at least buy a few sets and see what happened.

A couple of years later when a "few" sets had become a few more I was able to find [TwinLUG](http://www.twinlug.com), a group of people in the area already meeting to talk about LEGO and what they were doing with it. When [Max Braun](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bisonfuehrer/) came up with the original idea for the Micropolis standard I was excited to participate and ended up being the person who maintains [the official specification](http://twinlug.com/micropolis-micro-city-standard/). When we were revising the specification back in 2010 I was the one who came up with (and one of the few who has ever implemented) the Bluff extension.

As someone who identifies pretty strongly as an engineer I still like to think of myself as a Technic builder but the majority of my work in LEGO over the past few years definitely has been Micropolis.

You can find me elsewhere on the net at [my personal site](http://www.cavort.org), [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/cavort/) or the [LEGO Micropolis Discord server](https://discord.gg/mBPWvt25zz).
