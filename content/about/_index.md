Th intent of this site is to document the collection of Micropolis modules owned by Nathan Stohlmann and Jennifer Heaton. As some of the individuals who were involved with TwinLUG when the [Micropolis specification](http://twinlug.com/micropolis-micro-city-standard/) was first being drafted, they have been actively building modules ever since and have accumulated one of the largest collections of modules in the world and regularly enjoy displaying all or parts of it at various venues.

Nathan is a computer engineer and primarily creates his designs using CAD before assembling models with actual bricks. He is an active member of TwinLUG, has been the primary maintainer of the Micropolis specification since it's inception, and regularly participates in the [LEGO Micropolis Discord server](https://discord.gg/mBPWvt25zz).

Jennifer is an ethics professor and primarily create her designs by surrounding herself with bins of actual bricks.

Our collection also contains modules created by Gary Dokukil.
