The was the fourth elemental building. Whenever Nathan looks at it he says "Where are the doors?" At first I argued that they're almost invisibly set into the outer glass of the building. When that didn't work I finally gave up and told him there's a force field around the building that lets people through if they have the key.

The windows on the outside do look a bit like a force field. It's difficult to build something to represent air. You can't make it completely transparent and have it look like a real building that people might use or live in. I settled for a combination of lots of windows around a rainbow core, in a style that's completely different from anything else in the city. I can't decide if it's cool or ugly, but I like the fact that it's unique. 

The top of this building is an 8x8 trans blue plate that violates my rule about not having open studs on buildings. I would have preferred to tile the roof, but I couldn't resist the seamless trans blue top that looks like the sky.

I figured that someone who built a building like this would probably not put in real trees for landscaping. Instead, there's a tree sculpture--I tell people it represents the idea of a tree--in the corner.
