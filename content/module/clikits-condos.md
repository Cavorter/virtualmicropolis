[Clikits](http://lego.wikia.com/wiki/Clikits) was a LEGO line marketed to girls in the 2000s. I have very mixed feelings about the LEGO products aimed at girls--though I love the new Friends sets--but Clikits included parts that are unlike anything else LEGO has made. I was looking for a way to incorporate these pieces into a micropolis build and came up with this building. Since then I've used Clikits parts in several other buildings, but the Clikits tower is still my favorite.

At the time I built the Clikits building we had almost no tall towers in our household micropolis, and it stood out due to height and unconventional part use. People often ask me if the Clikits parts are really LEGOs. Now we have lots of taller buildings, and I think of the Clikits building as a mid-size condominium tower. When we set up micropolis layouts I'm always turning it around to make sure the side with the Clikits is visible.
