Sometime in 2012 the kids in the household discovered the television show [Phineas and Ferb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phineas_and_Ferb) and became quite enthralled by it. Thankfully, like all good animated television, the writers for the show make it work on many more levels than their pre-teen target demographic and since then I have found it to be quite entertaining as well. Enough so that it occurred to me in January of 2013 that the iconic headquarters for the evil mastermind in the series would make a fun addition to Micropolis.

There are a **lot** of problems with trying to replicate a building from an animated television series in LEGO, and doing it in micro scale only tends to compound some of those problems. To replicate from an art style that is distinctly angular but not squarely geometric makes for some moments of frustration. For example I am pretty happy with how I implemented the slant for the wing that hangs off the side of the upper structure. However I am still not quite entirely happy with the roof, but it's the closest I could reasonably come up with for now. It's the one section that is likely to get rebuilt at some point in the future.

At some point there will probably be an -inator that shows up on the module as well. So far I just haven't come up with anything interesting enough to use. If you don't know what an "-inator" is, ask someone who was the right age back in the early 2010s.
