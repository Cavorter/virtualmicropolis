Just to cover the obvious: Yes, those are large headstones. However I couldn't figure out a way to represent them in any smaller parts, and I think put together like they are it works pretty well without necessarily being the most realistic representation possible. The two mausoleums on the back part of the property seemed like a nice way to break up an otherwise very open module. I'm fairly proud of the technique used to set the headstone section into place using lots of clips under the fencing. This was also the first time we used this particular fence type, and I'm a bit surprised that I don't remember having seen it used before since it works as a fairly chunky wrought iron type of fencing, in this case with limestone pillars breaking it up.
