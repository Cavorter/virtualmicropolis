The [Belville Sunshine Home](http://brickset.com/detail/?Set=7586-1) was one of the last sets produced for the Belville line and I picked one up at some point for various reasons and so I have had those huge pink lattice parts kicking around for years waiting for me to finally do something with them. Inspiration struck during the winter of 2013 and the Belville Condominiums got built one evening. The building is just barely small enough to fit on a half block and so overhangs the sidewalk on three sides with a very modern green-space on the fourth.
