I secretly think of this as the Zebra Building. When I built it I wanted to make one of those buildings where the parking and entrance was underneath the raised-up building. I managed that part, but I'm not sure whether I like the design of this building or not. I think if I had to do it over again I'd make it a more complex shape. Maybe I'll rebuild it someday.

Showing that it's a post office was not easy. I finally put up the envelope tile, even though I can't imagine a real post office being marked this way. And there are all the mail trucks, though I'm never sure if they actually look like mail trucks or not. If we ever get enough trans gray cheese wedges (for the windshields), I may try substituting those for the black ones and see if the trucks look better.
