Back in late 2008 one of the members of TwinLUG, Roy Cook, was commissioned to build replicas of the [Minnesota State Capital building](http://www.mnhs.org/places/sites/msc/) and [Cathedral of St Paul](http://www.cathedralsaintpaul.org/) for the [Minnesota Historical Society](http://www.mnhs.org/). At the December 2008 TwinLUG meeting he proposed a contest to see who could make the best miniature version of either building that could be used as templates for mini-models that could be sold to help make back some of the cost of the projects. Around Christmas that year I started up my version of the Cathedral and it came out as a fairly nice little chapel so I went ahead and put it on a module base. It stayed pretty much exactly like the original version until very recently when Jennifer did some landscaping.
