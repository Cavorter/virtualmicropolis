At some point one of the most fun ways to find new ideas for Micropolis is to pick a city and pull up Google Street View or an equivalent and go for a virtual tour. While I was taking a look at Saint Paul, Minnesota I ran across the CenturyLink Tower and found inspiration. I don't often try and replicate a building as precisely as this attempt, but the form of the building lends itself incredibly well to LEGO. Though the sculpture on the side of the building is my imagination. In real life that side of the building is conjoined with an older building owned by the same company.

One of the best things about this building is that when we have displayed in the Science Museum of Minnesota lobby I can point at the building through the front windows and show people my inspiration standing just down the block.
