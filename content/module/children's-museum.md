St. Paul has a wonderful [children's museum](http://www.mcm.org/) where we spent a lot of time when the kids were small. My Children's Museum doesn't look anything like it, but I did get a few ideas for the details from the St. Paul building.

I've always had mixed feelings about this build. On the one hand it was great fun to build--I got to use bright colors and clikits and trans crystals and huge (for Micropolis scale) animal statues out front. I even decorated the inside of this building, though you have to really carefully peer through the windows to see anything.On the other hand I've never really liked the shape of the finished build. It looks like it was built in a particular style of 80s architecture that I've never much liked in real life. If I had to do it over again I think I'd make the building a completely different shape.
